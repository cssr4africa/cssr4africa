### The CSSR4Africa Project -- Unit Tests

<img src="../CSSR4AfricaLogo.svg" alt="CSSR4Africa Logo" style="width:90%; height:auto;">

The is directory contains the code and resources that perform unit tests for the CSSR4Africa project, based on the system architecture which is available in the [CSSR4Africa System Architecture](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.1.pdf). As of now, the available unit tests are [animateBehaviour](/animateBehaviourTest/), [gestureExecution](/gestureExecutionTest/), and [overtAttention](/overtAttentionTest/). These software have been passed through the software integration process as reported in the [System Integration and Quality Assurance](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.5.pdf). This integration process is based on the standards set out in the [Software Engineering Standards Manual](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.2.pdf) and the [System Integration and Quality Assurance Manual](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.4.pdf). 



# Documentation
Accompanying this code will be the user manual that provides guide on how to carry out the unit tests. The user manual will be available on the [cssr4africa](https://cssr4africa.github.io/) website.
