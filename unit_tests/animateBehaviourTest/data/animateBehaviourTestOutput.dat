        Flexi movement started: PASSED

        Joint names:
            left arm: ["LShoulderPitch", "LShoulderRoll", "LElbowRoll", "LElbowYaw", "LWristYaw"]
            left hand: ["LHand"]
            right arm: ["RShoulderPitch", "RShoulderRoll", "RElbowRoll", "RElbowYaw", "RWristYaw"]
            right hand: ["RHand"]

        Ensure the joint moves to the Home position before starting random movements.
        The values of the home positions are:
            left arm: [1.5625, 0.0997, -0.3434, -1.715, 0.06592] 
            left hand: [0.6695] 
            right arm: [1.541, -0.09664, 0.30664, 1.6981, -0.05679] 
            right hand: [0.66608] 

        After the joint is in the home position, start moving to random positions continuously.
        The random positions captured are:
            left arm:
