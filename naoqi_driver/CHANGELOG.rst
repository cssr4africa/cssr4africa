0.5.8 (2016-05-19)
------------------
* Update maintainership
* Fix broken compilation with libqi-2.5 (`#67 <https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_driver/issues/67>`_)
  -std=gnu++11 is not mandatory as this flag will be added when importing libqi
  (https://github.com/ros-naoqi/libqi-release/commit/c26f57e25326c9d3447ae7113818a474994e5544).
  naoqi_driver should now work with libqi2.3 and 2.5
* Contributors: Surya Ambrose

0.5.7 (2016-02-04)
------------------
* Fix termination issues (`#62 <https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_driver/pull/62>`_)

  * Fix deadlock in audio termination
    Calling subscribe or unsubscribe while the callback is being called
    is already protected on naoqi side. So no need to protect it on the bridge
    side, this is what previously led to a deadlock.
    We only need mutex protection on configuration variable (publishing,
    recording, logging) and also make sure calling subscribe and unsubscribe
    at the same time is not possible (even though this is also protected in
    naoqi).
    Change-Id: Iae604c047046fec9e24832dd4df5017ff4ae724f
  * Do not use qi::import for retrieving naoqi_driver

* Add tactile and bumper in boot_config.json  (`#59 <https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_driver/pull/59>`_)

  Automatically deploy ros from toolchain
  Hey !
  This is a very small MR to:
  1) Test the MR behavior when using branches on the same project
  2) To share my great progress: allow the ros toolchain to be deployed to the robot just by adding a word :D
  Hope you will like it ^^

  qibuild deploy
