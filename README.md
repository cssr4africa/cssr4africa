### The CSSR4Africa Project

Based on ethnographic research to acquire cultural knowledge about acceptable modes of communication, the CSSR4Africa project aims to equip robots with the ability to interact sensitively and politely with people in Africa using spatial, non-verbal, and verbal modes of interaction. 

The CSSR4Africa software repository is under construction.  Currently, there is are four ROS packages, all focussed on acquiring  sensor data  from the Pepper social robot and controlling actuators on the Pepper robot.

The system architecture [here](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.1.pdf) details the ROS packages that will eventually be part of the CSSR4Africa software repository.
