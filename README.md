### The CSSR4Africa Project

Based on ethnographic research to acquire cultural knowledge about acceptable modes of communication, the CSSR4Africa project aims to equip robots with the ability to interact sensitively and politely with people in Africa using spatial, non-verbal, and verbal modes of interaction. 

The CSSR4Africa software repository is under construction.  Currently, there is just one ROS packages, focussed on acquiring  sensor data  from the Pepper social robot and controlling actuators on the Pepper robot.

pepper_interface_tests

There are dependencies on four other repositories:

gazebo_model_velocity_plugin
naoqi_dcm_driver
naoqi_driver
pepper_dcm_robot

Details on how to install these and the CSSR4Africa software can be found in the software installation manual is [here](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.3.pdf).

The system architecture [here](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.1.pdf) details the ROS packages that will eventually be part of the CSSR4Africa software repository.
